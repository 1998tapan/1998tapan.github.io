The Planetary API is a robust web service designed to provide comprehensive information about planets within our solar system, alongside user management and authentication features.

This API allows users to access detailed planetary data, as well as perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on planet records. With user authentication and secure access controls in place, the API ensures a safe and personalized experience for all users.
