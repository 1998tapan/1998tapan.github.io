 With a core specialization in Marketing & Strategy, I've orchestrated impactful strategies in brand perceptions during my MBA summer internship for [Tata Structura](https://www.tatastructura.com) at [Tata Steel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhGTFz7pe6kP7bZ4peDgJ7hlG630K8rz/view?usp=sharing). 

 I also spearheaded employer branding initiatives for [Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w-uN9jb86pxFXPYMDu_78P-d1CZJAx3V/view?usp=sharing), resulting in a remarkable 37% surge in consumer engagement during my remote live project as part of my MBA journey.
 
 During my tenure at [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com), where I served as a Software Developer, I had the honor of being selected as one of 16 elite [Innovation Agents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16BGu5InZZDGCtoWas560ezwKsgVBKbI9/view?usp=sharing).
 
 Moreover, my role as a [Placement Coordinator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRTZfE7v5Y99BYZVxevaGBVtF90t-TOb/view?usp=sharing) at IIM Rohtak saw me cultivate over 30 new corporate relationships, culminating in a remarkable 42% boost in campus placements.

My skills are not limited to this list!
